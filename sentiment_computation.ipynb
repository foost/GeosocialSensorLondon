    "The problem is that any code point after the first gets added to the last word of the description. If that last word is the one to be found in the lexicon, the sentiment_valence function will miss it. So, in case of ‚òπÔ∏è (\"frowning face\") the word found in the lexicon is \"frowning\", and in case of ‚ù§Ô∏è (\"red heart\") it's \"heart\". Testing showed that the former works (so the problem does not occur with all emojis with multiple code points), the latter does not.\n",
    "The problem only occurs when the lexicon word is the last word of the emoji description, because the loop only looks at the first code point to find the description, but then adds the second code point to the last word of that description. This changes the last character of that unigram, making the sentiment_valence look-up miss it. The change is barely visible in control print outs (e.g. the letter \"t\" becomes a tiny bit smaller).\n",

    "How to fix it? Dealing properly with emojis with multiple code points would need some serious changes in the loop. We have chosen for a quick and dirty fix: Since the major culprit for sentiment-relevant emojis is \"FE0F\", we changed the ```else:``` statement into ```elif ord(chr) != 65039:``` to completely ignore it. Seems to work.\n",
